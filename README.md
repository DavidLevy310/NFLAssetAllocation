# NFLAssetAllocation
An Exploration of NFL Team's Salary Cap Allocation by Position and its Impact on Performance (2013-2018)

For this project, I webscraped data using scrapy from both spotrac.com/nfl and pro-football-reference.com. Project files included in this repository are both webscraping scripts used, data analysis and visualization using Python in jupyter notebook, as well as a powerpoint presentation I gave on my analysis.
